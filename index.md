## Experience 

**Jr. Data Scientist**  Mar 2018 - current  
*The LEGO Group, London*

- Something that you accomplished in your position; demonstrate leadership, teamwork, creativity, etc. Maybe show some numbers. Give some detail!
- Something else that you did. Don't be shy.

**Data Scientist**  Mar 2017 - Mar 2018  
*Ministry of Justice, London*  
The Data Science Hub works as an internal consultancy within MoJ, working on collaborative projects with a range of internal customers and more widely across government.

Notable Projects:
- Natural language processing with Parliamentary questions, including clustering and visualisation in Shiny. Tool is live within MoJ with c. 50 users per week, . Code is available on [github](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/pq-tool).
- Creating Reproducible Analytical Pipelines to automate statistical publications.


**Audit Trainee**  Oct 15 - Aug 2016  
*BDO Accountants, Belfast*

Main duties involved working on company audits, preparation of statutory accounts and monthly reporting of investment properties. While this was not a data science role, I gained a greater appreciation for how companies, across a number of industries, work and appreciate where analysis can help improve internal processes.
